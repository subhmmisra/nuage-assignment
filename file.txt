Hello world I am Shubham Mishra I am great,
The newer threading module included with Python 2.4 provides much more powerful, high-level support for threads than the thread module discussed in the previous section.

The threading module exposes all the methods of the thread module and provides some additional methods −

threading.activeCount() − Returns the number of thread objects that are active.

threading.currentThread() − Returns the number of thread objects in the caller's thread control.

threading.enumerate() − Returns a list of all thread objects that are currently active.

# Atbash Cipher Encryption

The Atbash cipher is an encryption method in which each letter of a word is replaced with its
"mirror" letter in the alphabet: A <=> Z; B <=> Y; C <=> X; etc.



## Instructions

Here this project is built using python.
Here we have tried to solve the problem with minimal effort.

This is a command line application which can be set to run by a single command.
## Documentation
In order to interact with the project we just need to
 run the under written command in the terminal.
```
Note: 
Make sure the input file should be in the same 
directory and in case it is not so we should be
 required to pass the correct path of the input file.
```

Post processing there will be an output file genreaterd
with the name "encrypted_output.txt"


```python
    python assignment.py speed file_name.txt
```
